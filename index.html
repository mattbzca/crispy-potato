    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p><em><strong>Cecil Percival Taylor</em></strong> was born on March 25, 1929 in Long Island City, Queens, New York and raised in Corona, Queens, growing up in a two-family brick home. <em><strong>Percy Clinton Taylor</em></strong>, the father of Cecil, was head chef at the Rivercrest Sanitarium in Astoria, New York, often indulging in spirituals like 'Wade in the Water' and music by Louis Armstrong. <em><strong>Almeida Ragland Taylor</em></strong>, Cecil's mother, played piano, was an actress, and was a dancer who spoke French and German. His earliest contribution to music publication began as a professional jam-session musician in the early 1950s, forming a quartet with soprano saxophonist, Steve Lacy, drummer Dennis Charles, and the bassist Buell Neidlinger. In 1956, <em><strong>Jazz Advance</em></strong> was the first recording for Taylor's Quartet before going on to the 1957 Newport Jazz Festival to create the album <em><strong>At Newport</strong></em>. His later outputs were mused—an esoterical journey—Taylor's importance as a virtuoso and musical innovator was apparent— these many releases became seminal for pushing the boundaries of music. Although, these performances came with a detriment; bewildered fans and passerbys did not know what to expect from the artist's idiosyncratic style, making it complicated for Cecil to secure performance venues. Prior to those events, Taylor began improvising and composing by the age of 8 from as early as the age of 5, when he began piano lessons under the instruction of Almeida. He attended the New York College of Music until he had to leave for Massachusetts to graduate from the New England School of Music in 1953, where he recieved more classical and conservatory training in tune with contemporary European art music, which renown jazz musician Duke Ellington believed to be essential for future jazz students and the advancement of their skills. </p>
